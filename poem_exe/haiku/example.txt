old pond ...
a frog leaps in
water’s sound

spider, say again!
it’s so hard to hear your voice
in the autumn wind.

soon they have to die,
but there is no sign of it
in cicadas’ cries.

while i'm gone
you and the nightingale are in charge
my snail

windy fall --
these are the scarlet flowers
she liked to pick.

o owl!
make some other face.
this is spring rain.
